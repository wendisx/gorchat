My original intention was to make a small communication system, but I don't have time to think about how to make this project go further, nor is there any need to make it go further. 
At first, I conceived a simple and efficient communication application, which could be a very simple program. 
Of course, this cannot be compared with real commercial products, and I know this very well. I may do it in the future, but reality is often not satisfactory. I need to combine a lot of technical points that look advanced, but in fact they are just some technical points that can be thought of by careful thinking to enrich my "project", but in fact this is not of much value. 
We don't have to deify an advanced technology. Excessive deification will only lead to ourselves forever regarding it as a kind of magic. 
Just remember one thing: technology comes from reality. The ideas behind it are what we should understand and learn in depth.

Just study the above architecture and you will gain something from it. 
In fact, the entire backend operation logic is just so much. of course, this is just the basic part.
