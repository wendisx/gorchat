My original intention was to make a small communication system,
but I don't have time to think about how to make this project 
go further, nor is there any need to make it go further. At first, 
I conceived a simple and efficient communication application, 
which could be a very simple program. Of course, this cannot be 
compared with real commercial products, and I know this very well. 
I may do it in the future, but reality is often not satisfactory. 
I need to combine a lot of technical points that look advanced, 
but in fact they are just some technical points that can be thought 
of by careful thinking to enrich my "project", but in fact this is 
not of much value. We don't have to deify an advanced technology. 
Excessive deification will only lead to ourselves forever regarding 
it as a kind of magic. Just remember one thing: technology comes from 
reality. The ideas behind it are what we should understand and learn 
in depth.

Just study the above architecture and you will gain something from 
it. In fact, the entire backend operation logic is just so much. 
of course, this is just the basic part.
